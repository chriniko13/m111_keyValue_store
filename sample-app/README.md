# Sample App


## Description
Due to the nature of `kv-broker` which has been developed to be an artifact (api library) and not
a CLI, this module is a simple app which makes use of the `kv-broker` library to interact with the `kv-server`.


### How to run
* Execute: ` java -jar sample-app/target/sample-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar localhost 8081 8082 8083`
